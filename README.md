# postgreSQL-database

In this project, I created the structure of a table with CREATE TABLE;
I performed queries with SELECT;
I added data to the database with INSERT;
I updated and deleted data with UPDATE and DELETE;
I filtered your records with WHERE;
I ordered your data with ORDER BY and
I joined table records with JOIN.
